						<p><strong>Quality Improvement:</strong> As our Department embarks on solidifying processes and their respective deliverables, we request that the matter being presented be reviewed objectively in order to reach a favorable outcome that benefit the transition team and all the parties involve in its process. Per our experience the transition survey can indulge in refactoring all areas of inquiries and data usage. This project proposal aims to streamline the transition survey and offer data that impact the client in a positive matter.</p>

						<h2>Statement of Problems</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p><strong>The Need:</strong> After careful review of the transition survey it is my believe that there are inconstancies in the reporting and data acquisition. It is my assumption that more accurate data can be formatted and directed to create a bigger impact in the transition of our physician. The transition survey is a convoluted process that involves SalesForce reports, Survey Monkey surveys, Excel workbooks, and emails in order to provide its recipients with pertinent information that still requires a careful review to make simple assumptions of the results being presented.</p>

						<p>This proposal has been partially designed as a discovery tool to unhearth better, more cost effective ways of handling the transitions process. We are delighted to hear any ideas or suggestion you may have!</p>

						<h2>Project Description</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="content">
						<p><strong>Posibilities:</strong> It is my bealive that due to the complexity of our services along side the amount of MDVIP employees that the physicians come in contact with that they often do not have/remember the appropiate information to successfully take a survey that provides acurate information. Granting a single location where the physican can search for his or her name to retrieve information such as name, phone number, and photo of the PDM,PDD, or anyone involved in the physicians' transition process. Additionally embedding SurveMonkeys' survey in the same location, and providing an opening message, videos, or explanations can potentially increase the interaction rate while retaining or decreasing overall time it take to complete the survey. The overall idea of the project is to review all transition survey questions and trunkate or remove all inecessary questions. Once the time of the survey has been diminish it is necessary to provided in the same location additional survey information particular to each physician. The physician should be able to find the information of everyone involve in the transition process and have all questions answered in the same location.</p>

									<h3>Responsibility of Original Material</h3>
									<p>The transition survey is responsible for providing appropriate information to executives and MDVIP employees that are concern with the process involved in the transition of MDVIP physicians. The transition survey is a KPI (Key Performance Indicator) orchestrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the transition process and how their respective business objectives are being achieve. Said key metrics are utilized in the decision-making process to drive the company towards efforts that improve the interaction of new MDVIP physicians that can potentially impact how physicians do business with MDVIP, and their members.</p>

									<div class="content">
										<p>
											The new material will mantaine the same responsibility as previous, but will expand and successfully introduce the transition survey in a matter that is more precise, removes redondencies, and more importantly it yields to better data. To accomplish this a server-side web-appilca utilizing front-end technologies, back-end technologies, and a seed in the database with all user information. The intention is to present the survey and user information via requests made to the client (web browser). The physician will navegate to a given domain name such as www.mdvip-transitionsurvey.com and be prompted with Transition Survey welcome message and a search bar. In said serach bar the physician will search for his/her name to bring up their Transition Survey team and respective information. This will follow with instructions on how to take the survey and use all the information provided for an easy and fast survey for the physician, but accurate and reliable survey for MDVIP. Additionally a contact form will be added for the physician to contact a Survey Transition designated MDVIP employee for further assistance or suggestions. Overall the new process will attempt to provide better data and reduce the margen of error in all sides.
